# Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction
This project aims to predict the sales of products at Big Mart stores using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing historical sales data, customer information, and store details, the model predicts the sales for each product at different stores, helping Big Mart optimize inventory management, sales forecasting, and marketing strategies.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical operations
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models
XGBoost: For gradient boosting and improving prediction accuracy
Dataset:
The dataset consists of historical sales data from Big Mart stores, including features like:

Product information (e.g., brand, type, etc.)
Store information (e.g., location, type)
Customer demographic data
Historical sales data for each product in each store
The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

Steps:
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.
Handled missing values and outliers.
Performed feature engineering by creating new variables from existing data (e.g., log transformation, encoding categorical variables).
Scaled numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized relationships between variables like sales, product type, store type, and location.
Identified key factors influencing sales performance using correlation analysis and visualizations.
Model Selection:

Implemented multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Compared model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Model Training & Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).
Trained models on the training data and evaluated them using the testing data.
Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search for optimal model performance.
Prediction:

Used the best-performing model to predict the sales for unseen data (future sales prediction).
Visualized the results and compared predictions to actual sales.
Key Insights & Results:
The best-performing model was XGBoost, which showed improved accuracy over other models like linear regression and random forest.
Feature importance analysis revealed that certain features, such as product type, store type, and customer demographics, played a significant role in predicting sales.
